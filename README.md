## 🛡️ Defensive Detection Tips
- Alert on apps requesting **camera + mic + SMS + location** together. 🚨  
- Monitor unusual outbound connections or frequent heartbeat-style traffic. 🌐  
- Use YARA on extracted APKs (strings, domain lists) — test in lab first. 🧩  
- Flag apps requesting accessibility or `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` without legitimate need. 🔐
